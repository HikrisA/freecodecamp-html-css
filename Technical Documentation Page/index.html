                    Microcontrollers are compact integrated circuits that serve as the brain of many embedded 
                    systems. They typically include a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals all on 
                    a single chip. Microcontrollers are widely used to automate simple tasks in electronic 
                    devices, from kitchen appliances to robots.

                    The PIC microcontroller family, developed by Microchip Technology, is one of the most 
                    popular and accessible microcontroller platforms in the world. The acronym "PIC" 
                    originally stood for Peripheral Interface Controller, though it now refers broadly to a 
                    diverse range of devices tailored for embedded applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PIC microcontrollers are well known for their simplicity, low cost, and wide availability. 
                    They are often used by students, hobbyists, and engineers alike due to their ease of 
                    programming, good documentation, and strong community support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find PIC microcontrollers in a variety of real-world applications such as home 
                    automation systems, medical devices, automotive electronics, and industrial control systems.

                    PIC microcontrollers are based on a modified Harvard architecture, which separates program 
                    memory from data memory. This allows the CPU to fetch instructions and data simultaneously, 
                    improving processing efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most PIC microcontrollers include the following core components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Central Processing Unit (CPU): Executes instructions and controls the operation of the 
                        microcontroller.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flash Memory: Stores the program code. It is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even 
                        when powered off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        RAM (Random Access Memory): Used for temporary data storage during program execution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory): Stores data that must be 
                        preserved between resets or power cycles, such as configuration values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I/O Ports (Input/Output): Allow the microcontroller to interact with external components 
                        such as LEDs, sensors, switches, and motors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Timers and Counters: Used for precise time measurement and event counting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): Converts analog signals from sensors into digital values 
                        for processing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Depending on the specific model, a PIC microcontroller might also include additional 
                    features like PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) modules, serial communication interfaces 
                    (like UART, SPI, or I²C), and watchdog timers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This modular and compact design makes PIC microcontrollers ideal for a wide variety of 
                    embedded applications.

                <p>
                    Microchip Technology has developed a wide range of PIC microcontrollers, each suited to 
                    different levels of complexity, performance, and cost. These families are generally grouped 
                    by their architecture and feature set. The most commonly used families include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        PIC10 Series: These are ultra-low-cost, small-footprint microcontrollers with very 
                        limited functionality. They are ideal for simple tasks such as controlling a single 
                        LED or button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PIC12 Series: Slightly more advanced than PIC10, this series still offers compact 
                        designs but with more I/O pins and better features, such as integrated ADCs and timers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PIC16 Series: A very popular family among students and hobbyists. These microcontrollers 
                        provide a good balance between performance and affordability, and support more advanced 
                        peripherals and programming options.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PIC18 Series: Designed for applications requiring higher performance, larger memory, 
                        and more advanced peripherals. They often support USB communication and complex timing 
                        functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PIC24 and dsPIC Series: These are 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers intended for 
                        high-performance and signal-processing applications. The dsPIC line combines a 
                        microcontroller with digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each family supports different instruction sets and development tools, but all share a 
                    consistent design philosophy that makes it easier to scale projects up or down based on 
                    performance needs.

                    PIC microcontrollers can be programmed in several languages, including assembly and C. 
                    However, the most widely used language today is C, thanks to its readability, portability, 
                    and support through tools like MPLAB X IDE and the XC8 compiler, both provided by Microchip 
                    Technology.

                        Writing the source code in C.

                    <li>
                        Compiling it using the XC8 compiler.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uploading the generated <code class="code-text">.hex</code> file to the microcontroller 
                        using a programmer such as a PICkit.

                    One of the most common beginner projects with a PIC microcontroller is making an LED blink. 
                    This simple task introduces you to working with I/O pins, configuring registers, and using 
                    delays—all essential skills for embedded development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this example, we will use a PIC microcontroller (such as the PIC16F877A) to turn an LED 
                    on and off with a 500 ms delay. The LED is connected to pin <b>RB0</b>.
                </p>

                    Before we start, make sure you have:
